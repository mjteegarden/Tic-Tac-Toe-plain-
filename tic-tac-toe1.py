'''
TIC-TAC-TOE
The computer plays 'X'; the user plays 'O'
'X' goes first; 'X' always starts in middle of game_board
All the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1
User inputs move by entering number of chosen square (number must be valid)
Program checks if game is over âˆ’ check these outcomes in this order: 
    computer wins (3 Xs in row)
    user wins (3 Os in row)
    game ends with tie  (all cells full; no wins)
    game continues (not all cells are full yet)
Computer responds with move and check loop is repeated
AI - random field choice made by program
